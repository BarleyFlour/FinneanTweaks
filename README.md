Finnean Tweaks (for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous)

FEATURES

• Tweaks finnean's progression so that he scales according to chapter instead of quests, i.e in Chapter 1 he's +1, Chapter 2 he's +2, etc.

• Allows you to choose enchants, a lower tier one from the start of chapter 2 & a higher tier one at the start of Chapter 4 (He retains Cold Iron and Ghost Touch regardless of enchant picks)
